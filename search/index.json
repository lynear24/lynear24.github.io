[{"content":"Art in Experience Artworks can help us understand what it might have been like to go through certain experiences, to feel certain emotions, or be in a particular position. They accomplish this by enhancing our experience to include things we may not otherwise go through or feel.Artworks, particularly literary works, can give us new categories for arranging things in the real world.We consider these qualities to be creatively important and appreciate some works of art for their complexity and elegance, the insights they offer, or the way they cause us to see the world in a new way. We judge other works to be artistically faulty because of their sentimentality. These are assessments of the arts that appear to also be or to depend on assessments. Such characteristics of our evaluations of artwork are taken seriously by artistic knowledge.\n  | tags:  ","date":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","image":"/post/art-in-experience/cover_huf253ae76dc807c73003f9de052a6d27a_155597_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"/post/art-in-experience/","title":"Art in Experience"},{"content":"Perpsectives in Art Even if Western culture continues to place a high value on art, it has always been reluctant to give it an inherent value or a meaning. Our admiration for art must be based on a timeless core belief art is good for us, even though we no longer seem comfortable expressing it. If we don\u0026rsquo;t think this is true, then our investment of resources—including time, money, and study—is pointless. What benefits of art might there be for us? The ability of art to encourage, comfort, and direct us toward better versions of ourselves as well as to help us live more fulfilling lives both individually and collectively is what gives it value, in my opinion.For some people, art\u0026rsquo;s ability to shock still serves as a major draw today. We are aware that, both individually and collectively, we risk becoming complacent, art can be worthwhile when it surprises or upsets us. We run the risk of forgetting how artificial some values are in particular.\n  | tags:  ","date":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","image":"/post/perpsectives-in-art/cover_hu142c7d067c6e0db18dd70d965fc773b0_529076_120x120_fill_q75_bgffffff_box_smart1_3.jpg","permalink":"/post/perpsectives-in-art/","title":"Perpsectives in Art"},{"content":"Tips on making Commissions As a budding artist, doing commissions is daunting. However, there are a few ways to help in starting out how to find commission work.\nMaking a Commission sheet Make a pricing table of your commisisons, and make sure that it is clear and easy to understand.

I also made a pricing table in a separate document that lists the terms and conditions.\n\r\nPromoting yourself through Social Media channels Ensure that you can be reached by making multiple social media channels.

It surpasses any generation or any method of creating a piece.

Digital art such as drawings that use advanced technology can attract people that are fond of art.

Having a personal portfolio hosted on your own platform is even better, as an artist can showcase their own talent however they want to.\nIf you’re looking to market your own artwork and make it stand out from the rest, either for increasing social media popularity or looking for more professional work, having an easily accessible portfolio online drastically helps in marketing your talent as an artist. Not only can you showcase your work, but other interested people can look at it and see your talent at a glance.\nHere are a few tips to help making a good portfolio:\nOne: Choosing an online platform You’ll need a platform or a website where you can upload and showcase your digital artwork. Popular gallery sites like DeviantArt and ArtStation can be a good start, but having your own platform lets you have control of how you showcase them.\nBlogging services like WordPress can be tweaked and set up to turn into a gallery-like interface. It depends on you how you want to set it up. Support for hosting is also very great for Wordpress. But the bottom line is that you showcase your own gallery however you like.\nTwo: Ensure that your artworks have good resolution This can go without saying, as presenting low quality images of your digital work in your portfolio might turn off people from looking at more of your work. Make sure that when you upload, place a higher quality resolution of the final image in your gallery.\nThree: Social Media links Establishing a presence online is important as an artist, as you want your work to be seen, and if ever you are selling your artworks or are accepting commission work, it is important that the potential client is able to reach out to you through your socials. Having good coverage and being active in multiple social platforms will help in increasing your network and popularity as an artist.\n  | tags:
