(there&amp;rsquo;s a route where she kills you, she still hasn&amp;rsquo;t lost her mercenary instincts)
“You didn’t kill enough Belkans, anon”
There’s really something off with the colored version, I’ll redo this in the future…</description></item><item><title>F-15C maintenance</title><link>/post/lewdcipher/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/lewdcipher/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Briefing</title><link>/post/briefing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/briefing/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Wingman</title><link>/post/wingman/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/wingman/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Demon Lord</title><link>/post/demonlord/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/demonlord/</guid><description>This is where it all started.</description></item><item><title>ISAF Valstrax</title><link>/post/valfalk/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/valfalk/</guid><description>sketch</description></item><item><title>Valstrax</title><link>/post/valstrax/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/valstrax/</guid><description>Sketch.

Colored version. I’m really happy how this one turned out!
After defeating another Free Erusea uprising in 2014, Mobius 1 finally retired from his military duties. Unfortunately, he was then captured by Belkan scientists. He was subjected unto different experiments and his consciousness was transferred into a bioengineered dragon capable of flying at mach speed.</description></item><item><title>X-02F Flying Wyvern</title><link>/post/wyvern/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/wyvern/</guid><description>Capable of autonomous or manned flight, this next generation of fighter aircraft will be the main antagonist of Ace Combat 8. The X-02F Flying Wyvern is a product of Belkan bioengineering in an effort to exact revenge against Osea a few decades after the Belkan&amp;rsquo;s bitter defeat.

I completely regret doing this.</description></item><item><title>Three Strikes</title><link>/post/trigger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/post/trigger/</guid><description>Stick with him and you&amp;rsquo;ll probably crash.</description></item></channel></rss>
